## Root UID skeleton directory

This directory should be cloned into your project's webroot!

### Which directory is the webroot?

If it's a .NET project it's usually under `Website` and the same
as the project name.

If it's a PHP project it's simple the `www` directory.

If you're not sure please ask a senior developer!

### Installation

Please check the [documentation](_frontend/skeleton-documentation/how-to-install.md)!
